A Rust-native MTG engine compiling to native and WASM, powering a Tauri desktop app, browser PWA, and WebSocket multiplayer. Implements comprehensive MTG rules using functional architecture — pure reducers, discriminated unions, and immutable state with structural sharing — with an Arena-quality React/TypeScript UI.

## Story

I'm Matt — a millennial software engineer who loves Magic. My six-year-old son asks me to play with him all the time, but the real game is just too complicated for a kid his age.

So I built [Alchemy](https://matthewevans.github.io/alchemy) ([source](https://github.com/matthewevans/alchemy)) — a simplified, kid-friendly version of MTG we could play together on our iPads. Fewer keywords, no lands, energy that builds each turn, and an adaptive learning mode where he solves math problems for combat bonuses. I had a working version in a single afternoon and fleshed it out over the following week.

After that I wanted to see how far I could push it — a real MTG rules engine in Rust, compiling to WASM, with the same React frontend so the whole thing runs in a browser. This whole project went from nothing to where it is now in a matter of weeks.

I'm not trying to make money off this. There are no ads. I'm just a dude who likes Magic.

## Features

- **Rules engine** — Turns, priority, stack, combat, state-based actions, layers, triggers, replacement effects
- **34,300+ cards** — Parsed from MTGJSON with format support (Commander, Modern, Pioneer, Standard, and more)
- **AI opponent** — Per-card decision logic, game tree search, and evaluation heuristics
- **Game UI** — Battlefield, hand, stack, targeting overlays, mana payment, animations, and ambient audio
- **Multiplayer** — WebSocket server with hidden information, lobby system, and WebRTC peer-to-peer
- **Metagame feeds** — Automated scraping of top decks from MTGGoldfish, updated daily
- **Deck builder** — Card search, visual builder, and `.dck`/`.dec` import
- **Cross-platform** — Tauri desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), browser PWA, and tablet
- **Card images** — Scryfall integration with IndexedDB caching

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)
- wasm32 target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- wasm-bindgen-cli: `cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli@0.2.114`
- wasm-opt (optional): `brew install binaryen` or `apt install binaryen`
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/): `npm i -g pnpm`

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phase-rs/phase && cd phase
./scripts/setup.sh     # Downloads card data, builds WASM, installs deps
cd client && pnpm dev  # Start dev server at localhost:5173
```

### Manual Steps

```bash
./scripts/gen-card-data.sh            # generate card-data.json
./scripts/build-wasm.sh               # Build WASM bindings
cd client && pnpm install && pnpm dev # Start frontend
```

## Architecture

### Rust Workspace (`crates/`)

| Crate | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `engine` | Core rules engine: types, game logic, parser, card database |
| `phase-ai` | AI opponent: evaluation, legal actions, search |
| `engine-wasm` | WASM bindings via wasm-bindgen + tsify |
| `server-core` | Server-side game session management |
| `phase-server` | Axum WebSocket server for multiplayer |
| `feed-scraper` | Metagame deck scraper (MTGGoldfish) |

Dependency flow: `engine` <- `phase-ai` <- `engine-wasm` / `server-core` <- `phase-server` (feed-scraper is standalone)

### Frontend (`client/`)

React + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + Zustand + Framer Motion + Vite

Transport-agnostic `EngineAdapter` interface with multiple implementations:
- **WasmAdapter** — Direct WASM calls (browser/PWA)
- **TauriAdapter** — Tauri IPC (desktop)
- **WebSocketAdapter** — WebSocket (multiplayer)
- **P2PHostAdapter / P2PGuestAdapter** — WebRTC peer-to-peer via PeerJS

### Design Principles

- **Pure reducers** — `apply(state, action) -> ActionResult` with no mutation
- **Discriminated unions** — Rust enums serialize to tagged TS unions via serde + tsify
- **Structural sharing** — Immutable state via rpds persistent data structures

## Development

### Build Commands

```bash
# Rust (uses cargo-nextest for test execution)
cargo test-all                             # Run all tests (nextest)
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings  # Lint
cargo fmt --all -- --check                 # Format check

# WASM
./scripts/build-wasm.sh                    # Build WASM (release)
./scripts/build-wasm.sh debug              # Build WASM (debug)

# Frontend
cd client
pnpm install                               # Install dependencies
pnpm dev                                   # Vite dev server
pnpm build                                 # TypeScript check + Vite build
pnpm lint                                  # ESLint
pnpm test                                  # Vitest
```

### Cargo Aliases

```
cargo test-all          # Run all tests (nextest)
cargo clippy-strict     # Lint with -D warnings
cargo export-cards      # Run card data exporter
cargo coverage          # Card support coverage report
cargo wasm              # Build WASM (debug)
cargo wasm-release      # Build WASM (release)
cargo serve             # Run multiplayer server
cargo scrape-feeds      # Scrape metagame feeds
```
