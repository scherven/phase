/// Status of a player in the game. Mirrors `PhaseStatus` for permanents — a
/// phased-out player is treated as though they don't exist for targeting,
/// damage, attacking, and SBA loss-from-life purposes, but they remain in the
/// game state (never removed from `state.players`). Their phased-out turn
/// proceeds with the player still as the active player; the status is cleared
/// at the next time a `Duration::UntilYourNextTurn` effect that phased them
/// out would expire (the active player's untap step).
///
/// CR 702.26 governs *permanent* phasing only; the player-phasing semantics
/// are derived from card Oracle text on the small set of cards (e.g.,
/// historical Teferi's Protection wording) that say "you phase out". The
/// invariants below mirror the permanent-phasing invariants:
///
/// - Status is the sole encoding of phased-in vs phased-out — the player
///   never leaves `state.players`.
/// - While phased out, the player can't be targeted, attacked, dealt damage,
///   or lose the game from 0-or-less life. These exclusions live at single
///   choke points (`game/targeting.rs::add_players`,
///   `game/combat.rs::get_valid_attack_targets`,
///   `game/effects/deal_damage.rs::apply_damage_after_replacement`,
