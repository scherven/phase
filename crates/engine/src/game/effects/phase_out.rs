//! CR 702.26: Phase Out / Phase In resolvers for the `Effect::PhaseOut` and
//! `Effect::PhaseIn` variants. All phasing primitives live in
//! `game::phasing`; this module is the thin effect-handler glue that
//! dispatches resolved targets to those primitives and emits the
//! `EffectResolved` bookkeeping event.
//!
//! Both resolvers handle player and object targets in a single pass:
//! explicit `TargetRef::Player` targets and player-typed mass filters
//! (`Controller`, `Player`, `Typed { type_filters: [], … }`) route through
//! `phase_out_player`/`phase_in_player`; everything else routes through the
//! permanent path (CR 702.26 proper). Player phasing has no formal CR rule
//! and follows the small set of card Oracle text that says "you phase out".
