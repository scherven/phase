//! CR 702.96b: Overload — transform every `target` in a spell's text to `each`.
//!
//! When a spell is cast with `CastingVariant::Overload`, its ability tree is
//! rewritten at cast-preparation time: target-bearing effects are promoted to
//! their all-matching counterparts. Per CR 702.96c the overloaded spell has
//! no targets, so the transformed effects carry no `TargetRef` slots and
//! target selection is naturally skipped.
//!
//! Single authority: every call site routes through [`transform_ability_def`].
//! No scattered `target → each` logic is permitted elsewhere.
//!
//! Effects transformed (covers the printed Overload corpus):
//! - `Destroy { target, cant_regenerate }` → `DestroyAll { target, cant_regenerate }`
//! - `Pump { power, toughness, target }` → `PumpAll { power, toughness, target }`
//! - `DealDamage { amount, target, damage_source }` → `DamageAll { amount, target, player_filter: None }`
//!   (the `damage_source` override is dropped: `DamageAll` always resolves
//!   with the resolving spell as the source per CR 120.3, which matches every
//!   overload card in the current corpus.)
//! - `Tap { target }` → `TapAll { target }`
//! - `Bounce { target, destination }` → `ChangeZoneAll { destination:
//!   destination.unwrap_or(Hand), target, origin: None }`
//!
//! Effects with no all-matching counterpart (e.g. `Counter` — Counterflux)
//! are preserved unchanged; the overloaded cast simply has no useful effect
//! for those. CR 702.96a's clarification that the transformation applies
//! only to the word "target" in the spell's text matches this behavior.
