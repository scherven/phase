//! Integration test for Gran-Gran (GH-87).
//!
//! Oracle text:
//!   Whenever Gran-Gran becomes tapped, draw a card, then discard a card.
//!
//! Parser lowers this to:
//!   execute = Draw(1, Controller)
//!     sub_ability = Discard(1, Controller)
//!
//! Bug (GH-87): When the trigger resolves, the Draw fires but the Discard
//! chain pauses on DiscardChoice. After the player submits SelectCards, the
//! post-choice continuation must drain correctly. The reported symptom is
//! that only one of {draw, discard} visibly fires.
//!
//! This test drives the full chain: Draw (instant) → Discard (DiscardChoice
//! WaitingFor) → SelectCards → final hand state. It verifies:
//!   - After chain entry: WaitingFor::DiscardChoice is active (draw already happened).
//!   - Library shrank by 1 (draw fired).
//!   - After SelectCards: chosen card is in graveyard; hand size = pre-chain + 0.
