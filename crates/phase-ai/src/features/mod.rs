//! Layer 1 — Features: dumb structural data extracted from a deck.
//!
//! Each feature describes a class of cards or strategic axis present in a deck,
//! computed once per game. Features are pure data — detection happens
//! structurally over `CardFace` triggers, effects, and filters (no card-name
//! matching). See `features/tests/no_name_matching.rs` for the enforced
//! anti-pattern lint.
