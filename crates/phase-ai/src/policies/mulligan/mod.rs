//! Mulligan policies — sibling trait to `TacticalPolicy` for pre-game hand
//! evaluation.
//!
//! CR 103.5 (`docs/MagicCompRules.txt:295`): the mulligan process — each
//! player may take a mulligan; mulliganed hands shuffle back and the player
//! draws a new hand, putting `mulligan_count` cards on the bottom.
//! CR 103.6 (`docs/MagicCompRules.txt:305`): opening-hand actions after the
//! mulligan process is complete (companion reveals, "begin the game with ~"
//! abilities) — not modeled here, but motivates why the mulligan decision
//! is a first-class AI concern.
//!
//! Each `MulliganPolicy` returns a `MulliganScore` — either `ForceMulligan`
//! (hard veto) or `Score { delta, reason }` (additive). The registry runs all
//! registered policies and aggregates:
//!
//! - Any `ForceMulligan` → the hand is mulliganed (reason kept in trace).
//! - Otherwise `sum(delta) > 0.0` means keep.
//!
//! Structured `PolicyReason` values give observability parity with
//! `TacticalPolicy` — `RUST_LOG=phase_ai::decision_trace=debug` emits the
//! per-policy trace.
