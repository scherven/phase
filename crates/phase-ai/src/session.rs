//! `AiSession` — per-game cache shared across all decisions.
//!
//! Layered architecture:
//! - Layer 1 (`features`): structural deck data, computed once.
//! - Layer 2 (`plan`): static schedule prior, derived from features.
//! - Layer 3 (policies): consume features + plan + game state per-decision.
//!
//! `AiSession` is `Arc`-wrapped on `AiContext` so cloning the context stays
//! cheap (a refcount bump).
